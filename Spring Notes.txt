Spring Notes
============


* What is Spring?

	Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java-based applications.

* Framework vs Library?

	Framework: Provides a comprehensive structure and dictates the flow of your application. It calls your code and imposes conventions.

	Library: Offers specific functionality that you use as needed, allowing you to control when and how it's used. Your code calls the library.


* Why we use Spring in Java?

	Dependency Injection (DI): Manages dependencies and promotes loose coupling.

	Modularity: Allows use of only needed components and offers flexible configuration.

	Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Manages cross-cutting concerns like logging and security.

	Data Access: Simplifies database interactions and transaction management.

	Spring MVC: Provides a structured approach for building web applications and RESTful services.

	Spring Boot: Eases setup with default configurations and embedded servers, speeding up development.

	Spring Security: Offers comprehensive security features.

	Spring Cloud: Supports microservices architectures with tools for service discovery and management.

	Community and Ecosystem: Benefits from a strong community and a rich set of additional tools and projects.

	Integration: Works well with various technologies and frameworks.



* Shortcomings of Java EE?

	Shortcomings of Java EE
	------------------------
	Complexity: Heavyweight with extensive configuration and boilerplate code.

	Slow Development: Verbose setup and complex deployment processes.

	Inflexibility: Tight coupling and potential vendor lock-in.

	Performance Overhead: Resource-intensive and may impact performance.

	Monolithic Nature: Often leads to monolithic architecture, limiting scalability.

	
* What is Tight Coupling , Loose Coupling & Need for Loose Coupling?


Tight Coupling
--------------

Definition: The components or classes in a system are highly dependent on each other. Changes in one component often necessitate changes in other dependent components.

Characteristics:
----------------
High Dependence: Components are closely linked; changes affect others.

Impactful Changes: Modifications in one often require changes in others.

Low Flexibility: Harder to update or replace components.

Limited Reusability: Components are less reusable in other contexts.


Loose Coupling
--------------

Definition: The components or classes have minimal dependencies on each other. They interact through well-defined interfaces or contracts, allowing them to be modified or replaced with minimal impact on other components.


Characteristics:
----------------
Minimal Dependence: Components interact through abstract interfaces.

Low Impact Changes: Changes in one component have minimal effect on others.

High Flexibility: Easier to update or replace components.

Enhanced Reusability: Components are more reusable in different contexts.



Need for Loose Coupling
-----------------------

	Improved Modularity: Enhances modularity and manageability of components.

	Easier Testing: Allows for isolated testing of components.

	Flexibility and Maintainability: Simplifies changes and maintenance, adapting to evolving requirements.

	Enhanced Reusability: Promotes reuse of components across different applications.

	Scalability: Supports scalable architectures by allowing independent scaling of components.



* What is Managing Beans, The Spring Container, Inversion of Control?

Managing Beans
==============
Definition: Managing beans refers to the process of creating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of Java objects (beans) within the Spring framework.

Key Points:
-----------

Bean Lifecycle: Spring handles the instantiation, initialization, and destruction of beans.
Configuration: Beans are defined and configured in Spring’s context through XML, annotations, or Java code.

The Spring Container
====================
Definition: The Spring Container is the core component that manages the complete lifecycle of beans and their dependencies within a Spring application.

Key Points:
-----------
Bean Factory: Provides the foundational container that supports dependency injection.
Application Context: A more advanced container that adds additional features like event propagation and declarative mechanisms.

Inversion of Control (IoC)
==========================
Definition: Inversion of Control is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the application code to a framework (like Spring).

Key Points:
----------
Dependency Injection: A key implementation of IoC, where dependencies are injected into beans rather than beans creating or looking up their dependencies.
Decoupling: Promotes loose coupling between components by handling dependencies externally.


* The Factory Pattern?

Definition: The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

Key Points:
-----------
Abstract Creation: Provides an abstract method for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Encapsulation: Encapsulates object creation logic, making the system more modular and easier to manage.

Usage: Commonly used to manage and maintain object creation in complex systems, promoting code reusability and flexibility.


* Configuration Metadata - XML, @Component, Auto-Detecting Beans

Configuration Metadata
======================
Definition: Configuration metadata in Spring specifies how beans should be created, configured, and managed within the Spring container.

XML Configuration
==================
Definition: Uses XML files to define and configure beans, their properties, and their relationships.

Key Points:
-----------
Verbose: Requires detailed XML declarations for each bean and its dependencies.
Legacy: Historically common but less favored in modern applications due to verbosity.

@Component Annotation
=======================
Definition: An annotation-based approach to define and register beans in the Spring container.

Key Points:
----------
Simplified Configuration: Automatically detects and registers classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller.
Class-Level: Place the annotation on the class to mark it as a Spring-managed bean.

Auto-Detecting Beans
=====================
Definition: Spring automatically scans and detects beans in specified packages based on annotations.

Key Points:
-----------
Component Scanning: Configured using @ComponentScan to specify packages where Spring should look for annotated classes.
Automatic Registration: Beans are automatically registered in the Spring container without explicit XML or manual configuration.



* Dependencies and Dependency Injection (DI) with the BeanFactory

Dependencies
=============

Definition: Dependencies are objects or resources that a class needs to function. These are often other classes or services that a class depends on to perform its operations.

Key Points:
-----------
Loose Coupling
Injection: Dependencies are often injected into a class rather than the class creating or managing its dependencies.

Dependency Injection (DI)
=========================
Definition: Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to inject dependencies into a class rather than the class creating them itself.

Key Points:
-----------
Inversion of Control
Types: Can be performed via constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

BeanFactory
============
Definition: BeanFactory is the simplest container in Spring that provides the fundamental support for dependency injection and bean lifecycle management.

Key Points:
-----------
Basic Container: Handles bean creation, configuration, and dependency injection.

Lazy Initialization: Beans are created only when requested, not at container startup.

Basic Features: Offers essential features but lacks advanced functionalities like event handling and internationalization found in ApplicationContext.
Summary

* Setter Injection

Definition: Setter Injection is a form of Dependency Injection where dependencies are provided to a class through setter methods rather than through the constructor or directly.

For Example
-----------


public class MyService {
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    // Setter method for dependency injection
    public void setMyRepository(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }
}

Usage in XML Configuration
--------------------------

<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
    <property name="myRepository" ref="myRepository"/>
</bean>

usage in Annotation
-------------------
@Component
public class MyService {
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Autowired
    public void setMyRepository(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }
}


Key Points:
-----------
Method-Based: Dependencies are set via public setter methods after the bean is instantiated.
Optional Dependencies: Allows optional dependencies because setters can be invoked only for the dependencies that are needed.
Flexibility: Provides flexibility in changing or updating dependencies without altering the bean's constructor.


* "Spring Container
   * The Spring Managed Bean Lifecycle
   * Autowiring Dependencies"

Spring Container
=================
Definition: The Spring Container is a core component of the Spring Framework that manages the lifecycle and configuration of beans (objects) in a Spring application.

Key Points:
-----------

Bean Management: Handles creation, configuration, and management of application beans.

Types: Includes BeanFactory (basic container) and ApplicationContext (more advanced container with additional features).

Dependency Injection: Manages the injection of dependencies into beans.


The Spring Managed Bean Lifecycle
==================================
Definition: Refers to the series of stages a bean goes through from its creation to its destruction within the Spring container.

Key Stages:
-----------
Instantiation: Spring creates an instance of the bean.

Populate Properties: Dependencies are injected into the bean (through constructor or setter injection).

Initialization: Spring initializes the bean, invoking any initialization methods specified (e.g., @PostConstruct or custom init methods).

Usage: The bean is used by the application as needed.

Destruction: Before the container shuts down, Spring calls any destruction methods (e.g., @PreDestroy or custom destroy methods) to clean up resources.

Autowiring Dependencies
=========================
Definition: A mechanism provided by Spring to automatically resolve and inject bean dependencies without requiring explicit configuration.

Key Modes:
-----------
@Autowired: Annotation used to automatically inject dependencies. Can be applied to constructors, setters, or fields.

Types:
------
By Type: Injects a bean based on the type of the property.

By Name: Injects a bean based on the name of the property.

Constructor: Injects dependencies through a constructor.

Qualifiers: Use @Qualifier to specify which bean to inject when multiple candidates are available.



* "Dependency Injection
    * Using the Application Context
    * Constructor Injection
    * Factory Methods"

Using the Application Context
================================
Definition: The ApplicationContext is a more advanced Spring container that provides additional features over the basic BeanFactory.

Key Points:
------------
Bean Management: Manages bean lifecycle and dependency injection.
Features: Includes support for event propagation, internationalization, and bean post-processing.
Configuration: Configured using XML, annotations, or Java-based configurations.
Access: Provides methods to retrieve beans and access various Spring features.


Constructor Injection
=====================
Definition: Constructor Injection is a method of injecting dependencies into a bean through its constructor.

Key Points:
-----------
Immutable Dependencies: Ensures that dependencies are provided when the bean is created and are immutable thereafter.
Required: Dependencies are required and must be provided at instantiation.
Usage: Often used when a bean requires mandatory dependencies for proper initialization.


* "Life Cycle Annotations
   Java Configuration, @Configuration, XML free configuration 
   The Annotation Config Application Context"


Life Cycle Annotations
=======================
Definition: Life Cycle Annotations in Spring manage the lifecycle of beans, including initialization and destruction phases.

Key Annotations:
------------------
@PostConstruct: Marks a method to be executed after bean initialization.
@PreDestroy: Marks a method to be executed before bean destruction.

Java Configuration, @Configuration, XML-Free Configuration
===========================================================
Java Configuration: A way to configure Spring beans using Java classes instead of XML.

@Configuration: Annotation used on a class to indicate that it contains bean definitions. Methods annotated with @Bean within this class define and configure Spring beans.
XML-Free Configuration: Configuring beans using annotations and Java classes, eliminating the need for XML configuration files.

The Annotation Config Application Context
==========================================
Definition: AnnotationConfigApplicationContext is a Spring container that supports Java-based configuration, scanning for components and handling bean lifecycle management without XML.

Key Points:
-----------
Java-Based Configuration: Allows using annotations (@Component, @Configuration, etc.) for bean management.
Component Scanning: Automatically detects and registers beans annotated with component-related annotations.
